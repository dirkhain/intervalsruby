intervalsruby
=============

Solution to the overlapping intervals problem in ruby. The code requires the rbtree gem <pre><code>gem install rbtree</code></pre> 
to store the intevals sorted. The tests cover some functional sceanarios as well as a few performance tests generating up to 10 
million random intervals and calculating the maximum overlap among them.
